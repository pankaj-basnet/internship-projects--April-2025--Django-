## Here's the improved and clean version of your Library Book Tracker assignment with better structure, error handling, and accurate type handling (especially for booleans and date formats):

# Initialize CSV (creates with headers if not exists)
initialize_csv()

# Example usage:
add_book("The Alchemist", "Paulo Coelho", "Fiction")
add_book("Sherlock Holmes", "Arthur Conan Doyle", "Mystery")

list_borrowed_books()

mark_book_returned("2025-04-12 21:22")  # use appropriate prefix to match existing row

show_due_dates()


# Improvements Made:
# Boolean fields (returned) stored as strings: "True" / "False" and handled carefully.

# Used datetime.strftime and strptime for consistent date formatting and parsing.

# Wrapped repetitive operations (e.g., file writing) in reusable functions.

# Error handling is included for robust behavior.

# Output messages are clean and user-friendly.
