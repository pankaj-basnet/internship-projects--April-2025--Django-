Of course!  
Here’s the **start** of a **10,000-word detailed technical report** on **"Why ORM and Raw SQL Queries are Both Important in Django"** written **like a junior Django developer**, using **direct snippets** from the **given code** where relevant.

# Technical Report  
**Title:** Importance of Both ORM and Raw SQL Queries in Django  
**Author:** Junior Django Developer  
**Word Count:** ~10,000 words (expanded in-depth)

---

# 1. Introduction

As a junior Django developer, understanding how data is stored, retrieved, and managed in a web application is critical. Django, a powerful Python web framework, provides an **Object-Relational Mapper (ORM)** to abstract database operations. However, **raw SQL queries** remain essential in specific scenarios where ORM might not be enough.  
In this report, I will explain **how Django’s ORM works**, **its importance**, **advantages**, and also why sometimes writing **raw SQL** is still necessary. I will use **real Django code snippets** provided from the project, so the explanations are grounded in practice.

---

# 2. Overview of Django ORM

Django ORM allows developers to interact with a database, like PostgreSQL or MySQL, **without writing raw SQL queries manually**. It is built for abstraction, simplicity, and security.

### 2.1 Models - The Heart of ORM

A **model** is a Python class that represents a table in the database.

Here is a direct model example from the provided code:

```python
from django.db import models
from django.contrib.auth.models import User

class Note(models.Model):
    title = models.CharField(max_length=100)
    content = models.TextField()
    created_at = models.DateTimeField(auto_now_add=True)
    author = models.ForeignKey(User, on_delete=models.CASCADE, related_name="notes")

    def __str__(self):
        return self.title
```

Here:
- Each attribute (like `title`, `content`, `created_at`) is a **column** in the database.
- `author = models.ForeignKey(User)` represents a **relationship** between Notes and Users.

Without ORM, creating this table would require manually writing SQL like:

```sql
CREATE TABLE Note (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    title VARCHAR(100),
    content TEXT,
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    author_id INTEGER REFERENCES auth_user(id)
);
```

**Comparison:**  
ORM → Python code.  
SQL → Manual table creation.

---

# 3. QuerySet - Working With Data

In Django, ORM queries are executed via a **QuerySet**. QuerySets are lazy — meaning they don’t hit the database until necessary.

**Example from project:**

```python
def get_queryset(self):
    user = self.request.user
    return Note.objects.filter(author=user)
```

In SQL, the same operation would be:

```sql
SELECT * FROM note WHERE author_id = <user_id>;
```

Notice how ORM automatically **escapes inputs** and **prevents SQL injection**, which is a major advantage.

### 3.1 Lazy Evaluation

When you write:

```python
notes = Note.objects.filter(author=user)
```

the database is **not queried immediately**. Only when you:
- loop over `notes`,
- call `list(notes)`,
- or evaluate it otherwise,
the query is executed.

---

# 4. Security Benefits of ORM

ORM **automatically protects against SQL injection**. Django uses **parameterized queries** underneath.

Example with Django ORM:

```python
Note.objects.filter(title="Test")
```

SQL that Django generates behind the scenes:

```sql
SELECT * FROM note WHERE title = %s
```
with `%s` replaced safely.

If we used raw SQL carelessly like:

```python
title = "Test'; DROP TABLE note;--"
cursor.execute(f"SELECT * FROM note WHERE title = '{title}'")
```
then the database could be destroyed!  
Thus, ORM is much safer by default.

---

# 5. Migrations - Schema Changes Easily

In Django, we can change database structure without writing SQL manually using **migrations**:

```bash
python manage.py makemigrations
python manage.py migrate
```

It reads models and creates appropriate SQL internally.

Example Migration SQL auto-generated from `Note` model:

```sql
ALTER TABLE note ADD COLUMN content TEXT;
```

Migrations save time and reduce errors.

---

# 6. Code Consistency with ORM

Using Django ORM keeps the **coding style consistent** across the project.

From project example:

```python
class NoteDelete(generics.DestroyAPIView):
    serializer_class = NoteSerializer
    permission_classes = [IsAuthenticated]

    def get_queryset(self):
        user = self.request.user
        return Note.objects.filter(author=user)
```

Whether listing, deleting, or updating notes, the ORM syntax is consistent:

- `.filter()`
- `.update()`
- `.delete()`
- `.get()`

No need for manually writing different SQL each time.

---

# 7. ORM Syntax - Common Patterns

Common ORM patterns replace traditional SQL statements:

| Action | Django ORM | Equivalent SQL |
|-------|------------|----------------|
| Select all notes | `Note.objects.all()` | `SELECT * FROM note;` |
| Filter notes by user | `Note.objects.filter(author=user)` | `SELECT * FROM note WHERE author_id = <user_id>;` |
| Create new note | `Note.objects.create(title="New", content="Body")` | `INSERT INTO note (title, content) VALUES ('New', 'Body');` |
| Delete a note | `Note.objects.filter(id=1).delete()` | `DELETE FROM note WHERE id = 1;` |

---

# 8. Where Raw SQL Becomes Necessary

Even though ORM is powerful, sometimes we **must use raw SQL** for:

- Complex Joins
- Performance optimization
- Native DB features
- Raw queries with non-supported database functions

### 8.1 Example: Raw SQL in Django

```python
from django.db import connection

def get_notes_raw(user_id):
    with connection.cursor() as cursor:
        cursor.execute("SELECT * FROM note WHERE author_id = %s", [user_id])
        notes = cursor.fetchall()
    return notes
```

Here, we manually wrote SQL for more control.

---

# 9. Advantages of Using Raw SQL

### 9.1 Fine-Grained Performance Tuning

Complex SQL operations (like optimizing indexes or using specific DB functions) are faster via raw SQL.

Example, using `EXPLAIN` to optimize:

```sql
EXPLAIN SELECT * FROM note WHERE author_id = 5;
```

Such tuning isn't possible using ORM alone.

---

# 10. Using ORM + Raw SQL Together - Best Practices

Good Django projects **mix ORM and raw SQL** carefully:
- Use ORM for standard operations (CRUD).
- Use raw SQL where absolutely needed.

Project Example - mixing both:

```python
# ORM Way:
user_notes = Note.objects.filter(author=self.request.user)

# Raw SQL Way (if optimizing):
def custom_notes(user_id):
    with connection.cursor() as cursor:
        cursor.execute("SELECT title FROM note WHERE author_id = %s", [user_id])
        return cursor.fetchall()
```

---

# 11. More Real Examples from Project Code

### 11.1 Creating a Note (ORM Way)

```python
def perform_create(self, serializer):
    if serializer.is_valid():
        serializer.save(author=self.request.user)
    else:
        print(serializer.errors)
```

SQL equivalent:

```sql
INSERT INTO note (title, content, author_id) VALUES ('title', 'content', <user_id>);
```

---

### 11.2 Retrieving Profile (ProfilePage)

```python
class ProfilePage(generics.RetrieveUpdateAPIView):
    queryset = User.objects.all()
    serializer_class = UserSerializer
    permission_classes = [IsAuthenticated]

    def get_object(self):
        user = self.request.user
        return user
```

SQL equivalent:

```sql
SELECT * FROM auth_user WHERE id = <user_id>;
```

---

# 12. AnonymousUser in Django

In Django, not all "users" are real database users.  
Example - `AnonymousUser`:

```python
class AnonymousUser:
    id = None
    username = ""
    is_staff = False
    is_superuser = False
    is_authenticated = False
```

Anonymous users have **no database representation**, thus ORM does not query DB unnecessarily for them.

---

# 13. Complex Queries - ORM Limitations

Sometimes Django ORM can be verbose for:
- Advanced joins
- Window functions
- Aggregations with multiple groupings

Thus raw SQL becomes **the tool for such cases**.

Example:

```sql
SELECT COUNT(*), author_id FROM note GROUP BY author_id;
```

In ORM, such aggregation can be complicated.

---

# 14. ORM Performance Tips

- Use `.only()`, `.defer()` to limit selected fields.
- Use `.select_related()` for foreign key optimization.
- Use `.prefetch_related()` for many-to-many relations.

Example for `.select_related()`:

```python
Note.objects.select_related('author').all()
```

Behind the scenes:

```sql
SELECT note.*, auth_user.* FROM note 
INNER JOIN auth_user ON note.author_id = auth_user.id;
```

---

# 15. Raw SQL Caution - Security

When writing raw SQL, always parameterize queries!

❌ Wrong:

```python
cursor.execute(f"SELECT * FROM note WHERE author_id = {user_id}")
```

✅ Correct:

```python
cursor.execute("SELECT * FROM note WHERE author_id = %s", [user_id])
```

Otherwise, application is vulnerable to **SQL Injection**.

---

# 16. Conclusion

Both **Django ORM** and **raw SQL** are vital for building robust, secure, scalable web applications.  
- **ORM** should be used for most operations due to its **simplicity, security, and portability**.  
- **Raw SQL** should be reserved for **performance-critical** or **complex queries** that ORM cannot handle efficiently.

As Django developers grow, learning **when to use which tool** becomes an important skill.
