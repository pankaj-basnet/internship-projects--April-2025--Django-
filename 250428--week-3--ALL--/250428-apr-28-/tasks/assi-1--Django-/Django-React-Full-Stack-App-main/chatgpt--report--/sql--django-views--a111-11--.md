## 1. Introduction

When working with Django, a high-level Python web framework, one of the core functionalities you frequently encounter is its Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) system. ORM simplifies database operations by allowing developers to interact with databases using Python code rather than raw SQL queries.

However, while Django ORM is extremely powerful and efficient for most database operations, **raw SQL** still holds significant importance in certain cases.

In this report, I will explain why both ORM and raw SQL are crucial tools for a Django developer, demonstrate usage with code examples, and cover when and why you should use each.

---

## 2. Overview of Django ORM

The Django ORM provides a bridge between Django models (Python classes) and the underlying relational database (such as PostgreSQL, MySQL, SQLite).  
It allows us to create, retrieve, update, and delete database entries using Pythonic syntax without having to write raw SQL manually.

Example of ORM usage:

```python
# Example model
class Product(models.Model):
    name = models.CharField(max_length=100)
    price = models.DecimalField(max_digits=10, decimal_places=2)

# ORM Query
products = Product.objects.all()
```

Here, we can retrieve all records from the `Product` table without writing a `SELECT * FROM products;` SQL statement!

---

## 3. How Queries Work in Django

Django abstracts much of the database interaction process. Here's how:

### a) Model Definition

In Django, each database table is represented by a Python class called a model.

Example:

```python
from django.db import models

class Customer(models.Model):
    first_name = models.CharField(max_length=100)
    email = models.EmailField()
```

- **Each field** (like `first_name`, `email`) is a column in the database table.
- **The model class** is the Python representation of a SQL table.

Generated SQL (behind the scenes):

```sql
CREATE TABLE customer (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    first_name VARCHAR(100),
    email VARCHAR(254)
);
```

---

### b) QuerySet Creation

A QuerySet is Django’s way of building database queries.

Example ORM query:

```python
# Get customers whose first name is 'John'
johns = Customer.objects.filter(first_name='John')
```

Equivalent Raw SQL:

```sql
SELECT * FROM customer WHERE first_name = 'John';
```

QuerySets allow us to chain filters, exclude conditions, and order results easily.

---

### c) Lazy Evaluation

**Lazy evaluation** means that QuerySets are not executed until we need the results.

Example:

```python
# Lazy query creation
customers = Customer.objects.all()

# The database hit occurs ONLY when we iterate or access the results
for customer in customers:
    print(customer.first_name)
```

This reduces unnecessary load on the database, making Django applications efficient.

---

### d) Database Agnosticism

Django ORM abstracts database specifics. This means we can change from PostgreSQL to MySQL without changing much application code!

```bash
# settings.py
DATABASES = {
    'default': {
        'ENGINE': 'django.db.backends.postgresql',
        'NAME': 'mydb',
        ...
    }
}
```

If needed, we can switch to MySQL by simply adjusting the ENGINE.

**Code doesn't change!**

```python
Product.objects.all()
```
works regardless of the underlying database.

---

### e) Migrations

Whenever the model changes, Django provides a system to automatically generate migration files.

Commands:

```bash
python manage.py makemigrations
python manage.py migrate
```

This automatically creates/updates the database schema.

Behind the scenes, Django generates SQL like:

```sql
ALTER TABLE product ADD COLUMN stock_quantity INT;
```

---

### f) Security

The ORM automatically escapes SQL queries, thus protecting against SQL Injection.

Unsafe Raw SQL:

```sql
SELECT * FROM user WHERE username = 'user' OR '1'='1';
```

With Django ORM:

```python
User.objects.filter(username=username)
```
Even if `username` is malicious, Django uses parameterized queries, safely escaping inputs.

---

## 4. Deep Dive into Key ORM Concepts

Let's look at each concept with examples and relevance:

### 4.1 Model Definition

ORM Model:

```python
class Order(models.Model):
    order_date = models.DateField()
    customer = models.ForeignKey(Customer, on_delete=models.CASCADE)
```

Generated SQL:

```sql
CREATE TABLE order (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    order_date DATE,
    customer_id INTEGER REFERENCES customer(id)
);
```

---

### 4.2 QuerySet Operations

- **Filter** example:

```python
Order.objects.filter(order_date__year=2024)
```

- **Exclude** example:

```python
Product.objects.exclude(price__lt=10)
```

- **Order By** example:

```python
Product.objects.order_by('-price')
```

**Chaining operations:**

```python
Product.objects.filter(price__gte=100).order_by('name')
```

All these are lazy and optimized.

---

### 4.3 Lazy Evaluation Example

```python
queryset = Product.objects.filter(price__lt=50)
# No query yet.

products = list(queryset)  # Only now query hits the database!
```

Lazy evaluation allows combining and modifying queries before fetching data.

---

### 4.4 Database Independence

Changing from PostgreSQL to MySQL doesn't require ORM changes.

```python
products = Product.objects.filter(name__icontains='phone')
```
works in both.

SQL generated is optimized per database.

---

### 4.5 Migrations Example

Adding a field:

```python
class Product(models.Model):
    ...
    description = models.TextField(default='')
```

Commands:

```bash
python manage.py makemigrations
python manage.py migrate
```

Migration SQL:

```sql
ALTER TABLE product ADD COLUMN description TEXT DEFAULT '';
```

Handled automatically!

---

### 4.6 Security Example

Bad way (manual raw SQL, vulnerable):

```python
cursor.execute(f"SELECT * FROM user WHERE username = '{username}'")
```

Good way (ORM):

```python
User.objects.filter(username=username)
```

Protected automatically!

## 5. Advantages of Using ORM

| Advantage                  | Explanation |
|-----------------------------|-------------|
| **Abstraction**             | No need to remember SQL syntax |
| **Security**                | Protection from SQL Injection |
| **Maintenance**             | Easier schema changes |
| **Cross-DB Support**        | Easy database switch |
| **Consistency**             | Same coding style throughout |
| **Faster Development**      | Less boilerplate code |

---

## 6. Why Developers Still Need Raw SQL

Even though ORM is powerful, it’s not perfect.

Sometimes:

- ORM cannot represent extremely complex queries.
- Fine-grained performance tuning is needed.
- Special database features (like PostgreSQL's JSONB) are not fully supported in ORM.
- ORM-generated queries can sometimes be suboptimal for massive datasets.

---

## 7. Scenarios Where Raw SQL is Necessary

### 7.1 Performance Optimization

Example (complex join with aggregation):

**Raw SQL:**

```python
query = """
SELECT customer.id, customer.first_name, SUM(order.total_price) as total_spent
FROM customer
INNER JOIN order ON order.customer_id = customer.id
GROUP BY customer.id
ORDER BY total_spent DESC
"""
customers = Customer.objects.raw(query)
```

**ORM Alternative (more complex and less performant):**

```python
from django.db.models import Sum

Customer.objects.annotate(total_spent=Sum('order__total_price')).order_by('-total_spent')
```

---

### 7.2 Database-Specific Features

PostgreSQL JSON Query:

```python
# Raw query using PostgreSQL specific jsonb operators
query = """
SELECT id, data
FROM mytable
WHERE data->>'key' = 'value'
"""
```

---

### 7.3 Complex Aggregations

Nested CTEs (Common Table Expressions) or Window Functions are easier with SQL.

Example:

```python
query = """
WITH ranked_orders AS (
    SELECT *, RANK() OVER (PARTITION BY customer_id ORDER BY order_date DESC) as rnk
    FROM order
)
SELECT * FROM ranked_orders WHERE rnk = 1;
"""
```

Very difficult to express with ORM.

---

### 7.4 Migration Challenges

Sometimes in advanced migrations:

```python
operations = [
    migrations.RunSQL(
        "UPDATE customer SET email = LOWER(email);"
    ),
]
```

Raw SQL is needed!

---

## 8. Combining ORM and Raw SQL: Best Practices

- **Use ORM whenever possible** for simplicity and security.
- **Use Raw SQL only when necessary** for performance or special needs.
- Always **use Django’s `raw()` method safely** to prevent SQL injection.
- **Keep raw queries readable** and document them properly.

Example:

```python
# Good practice: raw query inside a method
def get_top_customers():
    query = """
    SELECT id, first_name
    FROM customer
    WHERE is_active = TRUE
    ORDER BY created_at DESC
    LIMIT 5
    """
    return Customer.objects.raw(query)
```

---

## 9. Code Examples: ORM vs Raw SQL

### 9.1 Retrieve Products > $100

- ORM:

```python
Product.objects.filter(price__gt=100)
```

- SQL:

```sql
SELECT * FROM product WHERE price > 100;
```

---

### 9.2 Create a New Product

- ORM:

```python
Product.objects.create(name='Laptop', price=1200)
```

- SQL:

```sql
INSERT INTO product (name, price) VALUES ('Laptop', 1200);
```

---

### 9.3 Update Product Price

- ORM:

```python
Product.objects.filter(name='Laptop').update(price=1000)
```

- SQL:

```sql
UPDATE product SET price = 1000 WHERE name = 'Laptop';
```

---

### 9.4 Delete a Product

- ORM:

```python
Product.objects.filter(name='Laptop').delete()
```

- SQL:

```sql
DELETE FROM product WHERE name = 'Laptop';
```

---

## 10. Conclusion

For a junior Django developer, understanding both Django ORM and raw SQL is **extremely important**.

- **Use ORM** for most operations due to its abstraction, security, and maintainability.
- **Use Raw SQL** when optimizing performance, using database-specific features, or dealing with complex queries.

Mastering both tools ensures that you can build fast, secure, and scalable web applications in Django.

Always **balance** between simplicity and optimization based on project needs.
