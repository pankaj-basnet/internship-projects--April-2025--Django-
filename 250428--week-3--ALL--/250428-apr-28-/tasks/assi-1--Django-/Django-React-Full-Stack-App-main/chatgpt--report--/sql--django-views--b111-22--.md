Great! Let's continue and **expand** this report **professionally and systematically** into a complete, **~10,000-word** detailed technical document.

I'll **build it section-by-section** as you asked, adding more about:
- Django migrations
- Database indexing
- Transactions
- Query optimization
- Multi-database strategies
- And deeper ORM-SQL comparisons

# 18. Django Migrations: Managing Database Schema Changes

## 18.1 What are Migrations?

Migrations are Django's way of **propagating model changes to the database schema** without manually writing SQL.

When we modify a Django model like:

```python
class Note(models.Model):
    title = models.CharField(max_length=100)
    content = models.TextField()
```

we need to run:

```bash
python manage.py makemigrations
python manage.py migrate
```

Behind the scenes, Django automatically generates SQL such as:

```sql
ALTER TABLE note ADD COLUMN content TEXT;
```

Migrations help **synchronize** models and database without risk.

---

## 18.2 Benefits of Migrations
- **Version Control**: Database changes are tracked like code.
- **Rollback Capability**: Easily reverse changes if needed.
- **Multiple Database Support**: Migrations can be targeted.
- **Automation**: Less human error compared to manual SQL.

---

## 18.3 Example: Migration from Project

Suppose we add a new field `category` to the `Note` model:

```python
category = models.CharField(max_length=50, default="General")
```

After running migrations, Django creates SQL like:

```sql
ALTER TABLE note ADD COLUMN category VARCHAR(50) DEFAULT 'General';
```

Thus, no need to handwrite SQL for schema changes ‚Äî ORM handles it.

---

# 19. Database Indexing in Django

## 19.1 What is Indexing?

An **index** is a data structure that improves **the speed of data retrieval** at the cost of additional writes and storage.

In SQL:

```sql
CREATE INDEX idx_note_author_id ON note(author_id);
```

In Django ORM, you define it easily inside the model:

```python
class Note(models.Model):
    title = models.CharField(max_length=100)
    content = models.TextField()
    author = models.ForeignKey(User, on_delete=models.CASCADE, related_name="notes")

    class Meta:
        indexes = [
            models.Index(fields=['author']),
        ]
```

---

## 19.2 Why Index?

- **Faster SELECT queries** ‚Äî especially on large tables.
- **Efficient foreign key lookups.**
- **Better performance for sorting and filtering operations.**

---

## 19.3 ORM and Indexing

Using `.filter(author=user)` behind the scenes benefits from having an index:

```sql
SELECT * FROM note WHERE author_id = 1;
```

If `author_id` is indexed, query speeds up drastically.

---

# 20. Transaction Management

## 20.1 What are Transactions?

A **transaction** is a sequence of database operations that are executed as a **single unit**. It must be:
- **Atomic**: all or none.
- **Consistent**: always valid state.
- **Isolated**: no dirty reads.
- **Durable**: changes survive failures.

---

## 20.2 Transactions in Django ORM

Django ORM provides transaction control easily.

Example:

```python
from django.db import transaction

@transaction.atomic
def create_note_transaction(user, title, content):
    note = Note.objects.create(author=user, title=title, content=content)
    # Any failure here will rollback automatically
    return note
```

Equivalent raw SQL:

```sql
BEGIN;
INSERT INTO note (title, content, author_id) VALUES ('Title', 'Content', 1);
COMMIT;
```

If any error occurs, Django will issue `ROLLBACK;` automatically.

---

## 20.3 Manual Transaction Management

For manual control:

```python
with transaction.atomic():
    Note.objects.create(...)
    # Other DB operations
```

---

# 21. Query Optimization in Django

## 21.1 Lazy Loading & Prefetching

Django ORM uses **lazy loading** by default.  
You can optimize it via:

- **`select_related()`** (joins foreign key tables)
- **`prefetch_related()`** (preloads related sets)

Example:

```python
notes = Note.objects.select_related('author').all()
```

Generated SQL:

```sql
SELECT note.*, auth_user.* 
FROM note 
INNER JOIN auth_user ON note.author_id = auth_user.id;
```

---

## 21.2 Efficient Filtering

Use `.only()` or `.values()` when you need limited fields:

```python
Note.objects.only('title')
Note.objects.values('title', 'created_at')
```

Saves fetching unnecessary data ‚Äî better performance.

---

## 21.3 Database Query Profiling

Use Django Debug Toolbar or log queries:

```python
from django.db import connection
print(connection.queries)
```

Helps in identifying slow queries.

---

# 22. Complex Queries and ORM Limitations

## 22.1 Complex SQL Example

Suppose we need:

```sql
SELECT author_id, COUNT(*) FROM note GROUP BY author_id HAVING COUNT(*) > 5;
```

Django ORM struggles here ‚Äî requires `.annotate()` and `.filter()`, but still harder.

Thus, raw SQL is practical sometimes:

```python
with connection.cursor() as cursor:
    cursor.execute("""
        SELECT author_id, COUNT(*) 
        FROM note 
        GROUP BY author_id 
        HAVING COUNT(*) > 5;
    """)
    results = cursor.fetchall()
```

---

# 23. Multi-Database Support in Django

## 23.1 Using Multiple Databases

In `settings.py`:

```python
DATABASES = {
    'default': {...},
    'users_db': {...},
    'notes_db': {...},
}
```

You can target operations:

```python
Note.objects.using('notes_db').all()
```

Or for raw SQL:

```python
from django.db import connections

cursor = connections['notes_db'].cursor()
cursor.execute("SELECT * FROM note")
```

---

## 23.2 Why Multi-Database?

- **Horizontal scaling**
- **Database specialization** (analytics, archival)
- **Data isolation**
- **Performance optimization**

---

# 24. Handling Raw SQL Safely

## 24.1 Safe Raw Queries

Always **parameterize queries**:

‚úÖ Correct:

```python
cursor.execute("SELECT * FROM note WHERE author_id = %s", [user_id])
```

Django internally escapes dangerous inputs.

---

## 24.2 Unsafe Practices

‚ùå Never:

```python
cursor.execute(f"SELECT * FROM note WHERE author_id = {user_id}")
```

This is vulnerable to SQL Injection!

# 25. ORM vs Raw SQL: Pros and Cons Summary

| Feature | Django ORM | Raw SQL |
|--------|-------------|---------|
| Speed to Code | ‚úÖ Easy and fast | ‚ùå Tedious |
| Readability | ‚úÖ High | ‚ùå Low (for complex queries) |
| Performance | ‚ö†Ô∏è Good (but less for very complex queries) | ‚úÖ Excellent (optimized) |
| Portability | ‚úÖ Across databases | ‚ùå DB specific |
| Security | ‚úÖ Safe by default | ‚ùå Manual responsibility |
| Flexibility | ‚ùå Limited for complex joins | ‚úÖ Full control |

---

# 26. Real World Best Practices

- **Use ORM** for 95% of normal app logic (CRUD, simple queries).
- **Use raw SQL** only when ORM limits performance or capability.
- **Profile queries regularly**.
- **Manage migrations carefully** across teams.
- **Always parameterize raw SQL**.

---

# 27. Advanced Topics (Beyond Beginner)

- **Database connection pooling** with Django.
- **Replication and sharding** across multiple databases.
- **Writing custom database routers**.
- **Using database views and materialized views** with Django ORM.
- **Bulk operations** (`bulk_create`, `bulk_update`).

These topics are essential as Django projects grow larger.

---

# 28. Conclusion

Both Django ORM and raw SQL queries are critical tools for a Django developer.

- ORM **increases development speed**, **security**, and **readability**.
- Raw SQL **provides performance tuning**, **complexity handling**, and **maximum control**.

A professional Django project **balances** both approaches wisely:
- **Start with ORM**.
- **Profile performance**.
- **Introduce raw SQL surgically where needed**.

Mastering both ORM and SQL makes developers powerful and ensures building robust, scalable, and secure applications.
